Introduction
Encapsulation is the mechanism of binding data (variables) and actions (methods) into a single unit, called a class.
Technically, every class is an example of encapsulation.
Real World Example:
Capsule :A capsule in which main medicine is encapsulated.
Car:A car is in which engine, wheels, and other parts are encapsulated.


Rules for Encapsulation :-
1. Private Variables :
Declare variables as private so that they cannot be accessed directly from outside the class.
2. Public Getter & Setter Methdos :
Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the private variables.


Use of Encapsulation :-
Protects data: Hides data from direct access using private variables.
Controls data access: Provides controlled access through public getters and setters.
Allows data validation: Enables validation before updating variables (e.g., checking valid input).
Improves code maintainability: Keeps internal implementation hidden, making changes easier.
Enhances flexibility: Internal logic can change without affecting external code.
Prevents unauthorized or accidental modifications: Limits who and how data can be changed.
